** Version 1.0.3 - 2022-02-07 - Sacha Chua

subed now tries to avoid sorting already-sorted buffers, which should
reduce interference with mark rings and other things.

** Version 1.0.1 - 2022-02-01 - Sacha Chua

Added obsolete function aliases in case people are calling
format-specific functions in their code.

** Version 1.0.0 - 2022-01-02 - Sacha Chua

Format-specific modes are now initialized with =(subed-srt-mode)=,
=(subed-vtt-mode)=, or =(subed-ass-mode)= instead of the corresponding
=(subed-vtt--init)= functions.

I implemented the format-specific functions with =cl-defmethod=, so if
you have any code that refers to functions like
=subed-vtt--timestamp-to-msecs=, you will need to change your code to
use generic functions such as =subed-timestamp-to-msecs=.
