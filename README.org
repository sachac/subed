* subed
subed is an Emacs major mode for editing subtitles while playing the
corresponding video with [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]].  At the moment, the only supported formats are
SubRip ( ~.srt~), WebVTT ( ~.vtt~ ), and Advanced SubStation Alpha ( ~.ass~, experimental ).

[[file:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rndusr/subed/master/screenshot.jpg]]
** Important change in v1.0.0

~subed~ now uses ~subed-srt-mode~, ~subed-vtt-mode~, and
~subed-ass-mode~ instead of directly using ~subed-mode~. These modes
should be automatically associated with the ~.vtt~, ~.srt~, and ~.ass~
extensions. If the generic ~subed-mode~ is loaded instead of the format-specific mode,
you may get an error such as:

#+begin_example
Error in post-command-hook (subed--post-command-handler): (cl-no-applicable-method subed--subtitle-id)
#+end_example

If you set ~auto-mode-alist~ manually in your config, please make sure
you associate extensions the appropriate format-specific mode instead
of ~subed-mode~. The specific backend functions (ex:
~subed-srt--jump-to-subtitle-id~) are also deprecated in favor of
using generic functions such as ~subed-jump-to-subtitle-id~.

** Features
   - Quickly jump to next (~M-n~) and previous (~M-p~) subtitle text.
   - Quickly jump to the beginning (~C-M-a~) and end (~C-M-e~) of the current
     subtitle's text.
   - Insert subtitles evenly spaced throughout the available space (~M-i~) or
     right next the current subtitle (~C-M-i~).  A prefix argument controls how
     many subtitles to insert and whether they are inserted before or after the
     current subtitle.
   - Kill subtitles (~M-k~).
   - Adjust subtitle start (~M-[~ / ~M-]~) and stop (~M-{~ / ~M-}~) time.  A
     prefix argument sets the number of milliseconds for the current session
     (e.g. ~C-u 1000 M-[ M-[ M-[~ decreases start time by 3 seconds).
   - Move the current subtitle or all marked subtitles forward (~C-M-n~) or
     backward (~C-M-p~) in time without changing subtitle duration.  A prefix
     argument sets the number of milliseconds for the current session (e.g. ~C-u
     500 C-M-n C-M-n~ moves the current subtitle 1 second forward).
   - Shift the current subtitle forward (~C-M-f~) or backward (~C-M-b~) together
     with all following subtitles.  This is basically a convenience shortcut for
     ~C-SPC M-> C-M-n/p~.
   - Scale all subtitles or all marked subtitles forward (~C-M-x~) or backward
     (~C-M-S-x~) in time without changing subtitle duration.  A prefix argument
     sets the number of milliseconds for the current session (e.g. ~C-u 500
     C-M-x~ moves the last [or last marked] subtitle forward 500ms and
     proportionally scales all [or all marked] subtitles based on this time
     extension.  Similarly, ~C-u 500 C-M-S-x~ moves the last [or last marked]
     subtitle backward 500ms and proportionally scales all [or all marked]
     subtitles based on this time contraction).  This can be extremely useful to
     correct synchronization issues in existing subtitle files.  First, adjust
     the starting time if necessary (e.g. ~C-M-f~), then adjust the ending and
     scale constituent subtitles (e.g. ~C-M-x~).
   - Show CPS (characters per second) for the current subtitle.
   - Insert HTML-like tags (~C-c C-t C-t~, with an optional attribute
     when prefixed by ~C-u~), in particular italics (~C-c C-t C-i~) or
     boldface (~C-c C-t C-b~).
   - Sort and re-number subtitles and remove any extra spaces and newlines
     (~M-s~).  This is done automatically every time the buffer is saved.
   - Trim subtitle overlaps with ~M-x subed-trim-overlaps~. By
     default, this adjusts the stop time of overlapping subtitles to
     ~subed-subtitle-spacing~ milliseconds before the next subtitle
     starts. Use ~M-x customize-group~ ~subed~ to configure trimming
     to happen automatically when buffers are loaded or saved, which
     time is adjusted, and how much time to leave between subtitles.

*** mpv integration (optional)
   - Open videos with ~C-c C-v~ or automatically when opening a subtitle file if the
     video file is named like the subtitle file but with a video extension
     (e.g. ~.mkv~ or ~.avi~).
   - Subtitles are automatically reloaded in mpv when the buffer is saved.
   - Cursor and playback position are synchronized:
     - Playback in mpv seeks to the position of the current subtitle as the
       cursor moves between subtitles (~C-c ,~).
     - The cursor is moved to the currently relevant subtitle as the video is
       playing (~C-c .~).
   - Copy the current playback position as start (~C-c [~) or stop (~C-c ]~)
     time of the current subtitle.
   - Playback is paused or slowed down when a subtitle's text is edited (~C-c
     C-p~).
   - Loop over the current subtitle in mpv (~C-c C-l~).
   - When a subtitle's start or stop time changes, mpv seeks to the subtitle's
     start time (~C-c C-r~).
   - Pause video playback without leaving Emacs (~M-SPC~).
   - Move one frame forward or backward (~C-c C-f .~ and ~C-c C-f ,~;
     pressing ~,~ or ~.~ afterwards moves by frames until any other
     key is pressed).

** Installation
*** Installing the subed package from NonGNU Elpa
~subed~ is now on [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/subed.html][NonGNU ELPA]].  On Emacs 28 and later, you can install it with ~M-x package-install~ ~subed~.

To install it on Emacs 27 or earlier, add the following to your Emacs configuration file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
(with-eval-after-load 'package (add-to-list 'package-archives '("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/")))
#+end_src

Use ~M-x eval-buffer~ to run the code, and then use ~M-x package-install~ ~subed~.
*** Manual installation

If that doesn't work, you can install it manually. To install from the main branch:

#+begin_src sh :eval no
git clone https://github.com/sachac/subed.git
#+end_src

This will create a =subed= directory with the code.

If you have the =make= utility, you can regenerate the autoload definitions with

#+begin_src sh :eval no
make autoloads
#+end_src

If you don't have =make= installed, you can generate the autoloads
with:

#+begin_src sh :eval no
emacs --quick --batch --eval "(progn (setq generated-autoload-file (expand-file-name \"subed-autoloads.el\" \"subed\") backup-inhibited t) \
	(update-directory-autoloads \"./subed\"))"
#+end_src

Then you can add
the following to your Emacs configuration (typically
=~/.config/emacs/init.el=, =~/.emacs.d/init.el=, or =~/.emacs=; you
can create this file if it doesn't exist yet):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Note the reference to the subed subdirectory
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/subed/subed")
(require 'subed-autoloads)
#+end_src

and reload your configuration with =M-x eval-buffer= or restart Emacs.

If you want to try a branch (ex: =derived-mode=), you can use the
following command inside the =subed= directory:

#+begin_src sh :eval no
git checkout branchname
#+end_src

*** use-package configuration

Here's an example setup if you use use-package:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package subed
  :ensure t
  :config
  ;; Disable automatic movement of point by default
  (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-disable-sync-point-to-player)
  ;; Remember cursor position between sessions
  (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'save-place-local-mode)
  ;; Break lines automatically while typing
  (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
   ;; Break lines at 40 characters
  (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local fill-column 40))))
#+END_SRC

** Getting started

~C-h f subed-mode~ should get you started. This is the parent mode for
~subed-srt-mode~, ~subed-vtt-mode~, and ~subed-ass-mode~. When
manually loading a mode, use those specific format modes instead of
~subed-mode~.
