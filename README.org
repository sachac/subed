* subed
subed is an Emacs major mode for editing subtitles while playing the
corresponding video with [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]].  At the moment, the only supported format is
SubRip ( ~.srt~).

** Features
   - Quickly jump to next (~M-n~) and previous (~M-p~) subtitle text.
   - Quickly jump to the beginning (~C-M-a~) and end (~C-M-e~) of the current
     subtitle's text.
   - Insert subtitles evenly spaced throughout the available space (~M-i~) or
     right next the current subtitle (~C-M-i~).  A prefix argument controls how
     many subtitles to insert and whether they are inserted before or after the
     current subtitle.
   - Kill subtitles (~M-k~).
   - Adjust subtitle start (~M-[~ / ~M-]~) and stop (~M-{~ / ~M-}~) time.  A
     prefix argument sets the number of milliseconds for the current session
     (e.g. ~C-u 1000 M-[ M-[ M-[~ decreases start time by 3 seconds).
   - Move the current subtitle or all marked subtitles forward (~C-M-n~) or
     backward (~C-M-p~) in time without changing subtitle duration.  A prefix
     argument sets the number of milliseconds for the current session (e.g. ~C-u
     500 C-M-n C-M-n~ moves the current subtitle 1 second forward).
   - Shift the current subtitle forward (~C-M-f~) or backward (~C-M-b~) together
     with all following subtitles.  This is basically a convenience shortcut for
     ~C-SPC M-> C-M-n/p~.
   - Sort and re-number subtitles and remove any extra spaces and newlines
     (~M-s~).  This is done automatically every time the buffer is saved.

*** mpv integration (optional)
   - Open videos with ~C-c C-v~ or automatically when entering subed-mode if the
     video file is named like the subtitle file but with a video extension
     (e.g. ~.mkv~ or ~.avi~).
   - Subtitles are automatically reloaded in mpv when the buffer is saved.
   - Cursor and playback position are synchronized:
     - Playback in mpv seeks to the position of the current subtitle as the
       cursor moves between subtitles (~C-c ,~).
     - The cursor is moved to the currently relevant subtitle as the video is
       playing (~C-c .~).
   - Copy the current playback position as start (~C-c [~) or stop (~C-c ]~)
     time of the current subtitle.
   - Playback is paused or slowed down when a subtitle's text is edited (~C-c
     C-p~).
   - Loop over the current subtitle in mpv (~C-c C-l~).
   - When a subtitle's start or stop time changes, mpv seeks to the subtitle's
     start time (~C-c C-r~).
   - Pause video playback without leaving Emacs (~M-SPC~).

** Installation
   For now, you have to install it manually.  For example, copy ~subed/*.el~ to
   ~$HOME/.emacs.d/elisp/~ and add ~$HOME/.emacs.d/elisp/~ to your ~load-path~.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (use-package subed
     ;; Tell emacs where to find subed
     :load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp/"
     :config
     ;; Disable automatic movement of point by default
     (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-disable-sync-point-to-player)
     ;; Break lines automatically while typing
     (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill))
     ;; Break lines at 50 characters
     (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local fill-column 50)))
   #+END_SRC

   ~C-h f subed-mode~ should get you started.
