* subed
subed is an Emacs major mode for editing subtitles while playing the
corresponding media file with [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]]. At the moment, the only supported
formats are:

- SubRip ( ~.srt~)
- WebVTT ( ~.vtt~ )
- Advanced SubStation Alpha ( ~.ass~, experimental )
- Tab-separated values ( ~.tsv~, experimental ) - as exported by
  Audacity for labels. TSVs are not recognized automatically because
  it's a common data format, but you can use ~subed-tsv-mode~ to turn
  it on in a buffer.

[[file:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sachac/subed/master/screenshot.jpg]]

** Features

- Jump to next (~M-n~) and previous (~M-p~) subtitle text.
- Jump to the beginning (~C-M-a~) and end (~C-M-e~) of the current
  subtitle's text.
- Merge subtitles with ~M-m~ (~subed-merge-dwim~) and split them with
  ~M-.~ (~subed-split-subtitle~). If the media file is playing in MPV,
  use the current playback position. If not, use the relative position
  in the subtitle text, or other functions listed in
  ~subed-split-subtitle-timestamp-functions~.
- Insert subtitles evenly spaced throughout the available space (~M-i~) or
  right next to the current subtitle (~C-M-i~).  A prefix argument controls how
  many subtitles to insert and whether they are inserted before or after the
  current subtitle.
- Kill subtitles (~M-k~).
- Adjust subtitle start (~M-[~ / ~M-]~ or ~C-M-[~ / ~C-M-]~ if Emacs lives in a
  terminal) and stop (~M-{~ / ~M-}~) time.  A prefix argument sets the number of
  milliseconds for the current session (e.g. ~C-u 1000 M-[ M-[ M-[~ decreases
  start time by 3 seconds).
- Move the current subtitle or all marked subtitles
  (~subed-move-subtitles~) forward (~C-M-n~) or backward (~C-M-p~) in
  time without changing subtitle duration.  A prefix argument sets the
  number of milliseconds for the current session (e.g. ~C-u 500 C-M-n
  C-M-n~ moves the current subtitle 1 second forward).
- Shift the current subtitle together with all following subtitles
  using (~subed-shift-subtitles~), or shift them forward (~C-M-f~) or
  backward (~C-M-b~).  This is basically a convenience shortcut for
  ~C-SPC M-> C-M-n/p~.  This is handy for correcting sync delays where
  the subtitles are correctly spaced but are offset from the audio.
- Scale all subtitles or all marked subtitles forward (~C-M-x~) or backward
  (~C-M-S-x~) in time without changing subtitle duration.  A prefix argument
  sets the number of milliseconds for the current session (e.g. ~C-u 500
  C-M-x~ moves the last [or last marked] subtitle forward 500ms and
  proportionally scales all [or all marked] subtitles based on this time
  extension.  Similarly, ~C-u 500 C-M-S-x~ moves the last [or last marked]
  subtitle backward 500ms and proportionally scales all [or all marked]
  subtitles based on this time contraction).  This can be extremely useful to
  correct synchronization issues in existing subtitle files.  First, adjust
  the starting time if necessary (e.g. ~C-M-f~), then adjust the ending and
  scale constituent subtitles (e.g. ~C-M-x~).
- Show CPS (characters per second) for the current subtitle.
- Insert HTML-like tags (~C-c C-t C-t~, with an optional attribute
  when prefixed by ~C-u~), in particular italics (~C-c C-t C-i~) or
  boldface (~C-c C-t C-b~).
- SRT: Sort and re-number subtitles and remove any extra spaces and
  newlines (~M-s~). This is done automatically every time the buffer
  is saved.
- Trim subtitle overlaps with ~M-x subed-trim-overlaps~. By
  default, this adjusts the stop time of overlapping subtitles to
  ~subed-subtitle-spacing~ milliseconds before the next subtitle
  starts. Use ~M-x customize-group~ ~subed~ to configure trimming
  to happen automatically when buffers are loaded or saved, which
  time is adjusted, and how much time to leave between subtitles.
- Convert between formats with ~M-x subed-convert~.
- Show the waveform (~M-x subed-waveform-minor-mode~, off by default)
  extracted from the media file using ~ffmpeg~ with the start/stop
  positions of the current subtitle and the current position in MPV
  marked along with the subtitle.  Change the "volume" of the waveform
  (i.e., the /visible/ amplitude) with ~C-c C--~ and ~C-c C-=~.
  Redisplay the waveform with ~C-c |~.  Left/right-click on the
  waveform to set the start/stop timestamps. If you would like to display the waveform automatically when you open a file, you can add ~(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-waveform-minor-mode)~ to your configuration.  
- Load word timing data (ex: SRV2) using ~M-x
  subed-word-data-load-from-file~. This will be used for splitting
  words at timestamps when available.
- Use ~M-x subed-align~ and [[https://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/][aeneas]] to align your text or subtitles
  with an audio file in order to get timestamps.

*** mpv integration (optional)

Using network sockets to control MPV works on Linux and on Mac OS X,
but not on Microsoft Windows due to the lack of Unix-style sockets. On
Microsoft Windows, you will not be able to synchronize with MPV.

- Automatically open the associated media file in MPV based on the filename, open a media file manually with ~C-c C-v~ (~subed-mpv-play-from-file~), or play media directly from a URL with ~C-c C-u~ (~subed-mpv-play-from-url~) . You can customize the automatic detection of files by changing ~subed-video-extensions~ and ~subed-audio-extensions~.
- Pause and resume playback without leaving Emacs (~M-SPC~).
- Jump to the current subtitle in the MPV player with ~M-j~
  (~subed-mpv-jump-to-current-subtitle~). Toggle looping over the
  current subtitle with ~C-c C-l~
  (~subed-toggle-loop-over-current-subtitle~).  Control how many seconds
  to loop before or after the current subtitles by customizing
  ~subed-loop-seconds-before~ and ~subed-loop-seconds-after~.
- Use
  ~C-c .~ (~subed-toggle-sync-point-to-player~) to toggle whether the point should move to the currently playing subtitle.
- Use ~C-c ,~ (~subed-toggle-sync-player-to-point~) to toggle whether mpv should seek to the position of the current subtitle when the point moves between subtitles.
- Subtitles are automatically reloaded in mpv when the buffer is saved.
- Copy the current playback position as start (~C-c [~) or stop (~C-c ]~)
  time of the current subtitle.
- Playback is paused or slowed down when a subtitle's text is edited (~C-c
  C-p~, ~subed-toggle-pause-while-typing~).
- Loop over the current subtitle in mpv (~C-c C-l~).
- When a subtitle's start or stop time changes, mpv seeks to the subtitle's
  start time (~C-c C-r~, ~subed-toggle-replay-adjusted-subtitle~).
- Move one frame forward or backward (~C-c C-f .~ and ~C-c C-f ,~;
  pressing ~,~ or ~.~ afterwards moves by frames until any other
  key is pressed).

** Installation
*** Installing the subed package from NonGNU Elpa
~subed~ is now on [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/subed.html][NonGNU ELPA]].  On Emacs 28 and later, you can install it with ~M-x package-install~ ~subed~.

To install it on Emacs 27 or earlier, add the following to your Emacs configuration file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
(with-eval-after-load 'package (add-to-list 'package-archives '("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/")))
#+end_src

Use ~M-x eval-buffer~ to run the code, use ~M-x package-refresh-contents~ to load the package archives, and then use ~M-x package-install~ ~subed~.

Sample configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'subed-mode
	;; Remember cursor position between sessions
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'save-place-local-mode)
	;; Break lines automatically while typing
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
	;; Break lines at 40 characters
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local fill-column 40)))
	;; Some reasonable defaults
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-pause-while-typing)
	;; As the player moves, update the point to show the current subtitle
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-sync-point-to-player)
	;; As your point moves in Emacs, update the player to start at the current subtitle
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-sync-player-to-point)
	;; Replay subtitles as you adjust their start or stop time with M-[, M-], M-{, or M-}
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-replay-adjusted-subtitle)
	;; Loop over subtitles
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-loop-over-current-subtitle)
	;; Show characters per second
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-show-cps))
#+end_src

*** Manual installation

If that doesn't work, you can install it manually. To install from the main branch:

#+begin_src sh :eval no
git clone https://github.com/sachac/subed.git
#+end_src

This will create a =subed= directory with the code.

If you have the =make= utility, you can regenerate the autoload definitions with

#+begin_src sh :eval no
make autoloads
#+end_src

If you don't have =make= installed, you can generate the autoloads
with:

#+begin_src sh :eval no
emacs --quick --batch --eval "(progn (setq generated-autoload-file (expand-file-name \"subed-autoloads.el\" \"subed\") backup-inhibited t) \
	(update-directory-autoloads \"./subed\"))"
#+end_src

Then you can add
the following to your Emacs configuration (typically
=~/.config/emacs/init.el=, =~/.emacs.d/init.el=, or =~/.emacs=; you
can create this file if it doesn't exist yet). Here's a configuration example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Note the reference to the subed subdirectory, instead of the one at the root of the checkout
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/subed/subed")
(require 'subed-autoloads)

(with-eval-after-load 'subed-mode
	;; Remember cursor position between sessions
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'save-place-local-mode)
	;; Break lines automatically while typing
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
	;; Break lines at 40 characters
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local fill-column 40)))
	;; Some reasonable defaults
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-pause-while-typing)
	;; As the player moves, update the point to show the current subtitle
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-sync-point-to-player)
	;; As your point moves in Emacs, update the player to start at the current subtitle
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-sync-player-to-point)
	;; Replay subtitles as you adjust their start or stop time with M-[, M-], M-{, or M-}
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-replay-adjusted-subtitle)
	;; Loop over subtitles
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-loop-over-current-subtitle)
	;; Show characters per second
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-show-cps))
#+end_src

You can reload your configuration with =M-x eval-buffer= or restart Emacs.

If you want to try a branch (ex: =derived-mode=), you can use the
following command inside the =subed= directory:

#+begin_src sh :eval no
git checkout branchname
#+end_src
*** use-package configuration

Here's an example setup if you use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package subed
	:ensure t
	:config
	;; Remember cursor position between sessions
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'save-place-local-mode)
	;; Break lines automatically while typing
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
	;; Break lines at 40 characters
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local fill-column 40)))
	;; Some reasonable defaults
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-pause-while-typing)
	;; As the player moves, update the point to show the current subtitle
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-sync-point-to-player)
	;; As your point moves in Emacs, update the player to start at the current subtitle
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-sync-player-to-point)
	;; Replay subtitles as you adjust their start or stop time with M-[, M-], M-{, or M-}
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-replay-adjusted-subtitle)
	;; Loop over subtitles
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-loop-over-current-subtitle)
	;; Show characters per second
	(add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-enable-show-cps)
	)
#+END_SRC

*** straight configuration

If you use [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]], you can install subed with the following recipe:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package '(subed :type git :host github :repo "sachac/subed" :files ("subed/*.el")))
#+end_src

** Getting started

~C-h f subed-mode~ should get you started. This is the parent mode for
~subed-srt-mode~, ~subed-vtt-mode~, and ~subed-ass-mode~. When
manually loading a mode, use those specific format modes instead of
~subed-mode~.
** Some workflow ideas

*** Reflowing subtitles into shorter or longer lines

You may want to use ~set-fill-column~ and
~display-fill-column-indicator-mode~ to show the target number of
characters.

Use ~subed-split-subtitle~ (~M-.~), ~subed-merge-dwim~ (~M-b~), and
~subed-merge-with-previous~ (~M-M~) to split lines.

Splitting will use the current MPV position if available. If not, it
will guess where to split based on the the number of characters in the
subtitle. You can use ~subed-mpv-jump-to-current-subtitle~ (~M-j~) to play the
current subtitle manually and use ~subed-mpv-toggle-pause~ (~M-SPC~) to stop at
the right time. Use ~subed-toggle-loop-over-current-subtitle~ (~C-c C-l~) if you
want to keep looping. ~subed-waveform-show-current~ can help you
fine-tune the split.

*** Adjusting timestamps

You can use ~subed-mpv-jump-to-current-subtitle~ (~M-j~) to play the
current subtitle manually. Use
~subed-mpv-jump-to-current-subtitle-near-end~ (~M-J~) to jump to near
the end of the subtitle in order to test it. Use
~subed-toggle-loop-over-current-subtitle~ (~C-c C-l~) if you want to
keep looping automatically. Use ~subed-mpv-toggle-pause~ (~M-SPC~) to stop at the
right time.

~subed-waveform-show-current~ or ~subed-waveform-show-all~ can be
useful for adjusting start and end timestamps. Use
~subed-waveform-set-start~ (~mouse-1~, which is left click) or ~subed-waveform-set-stop~ (~mouse-3~, which is right-click) to adjust only
the current subtitle's timestamps, or use
~subed-waveform-set-start-and-copy-to-previous~ (~S-mouse-1~ or ~M-mouse-1~) or
~subed-waveform-set-stop-and-copy-to-next~ (~S-mouse-3~ or ~M-mouse-3~) to adjust adjacent
subtitles as well.

You can also manually adjust

- subtitle start: ~M-[~  / ~M-]~
- subtitle stop: (~M-{~ / ~M-}~)

A prefix argument sets the number of milliseconds (e.g. ~C-u 1000 M-[ M-[ M-[~ decreases start time by 3 seconds).

*** Editing subtitles

You can use ~subed-mpv-jump-to-current-subtitle~ (~M-j~) to play the current
subtitle and use ~subed-mpv-toggle-pause~ (~M-SPC~) to stop at the right time.
Use ~subed-toggle-loop-over-current-subtitle~ (~C-c C-l~) if you want to keep
looping automatically.

If you have wdiff installed, you can use
~subed-wdiff-subtitle-text-with-file~ to compare the subtitle text
with a script or another subtitle file.

*** Writing subtitles from scratch

One way is to start with one big subtitle that covers the whole media
file, and then split it using ~subed-split-subtitle~ (~M-.~).

Another way is to type as much of the text as you can without worrying
about timestamps, putting each caption on a separate line. Then you
can use ~subed-align~ to convert it into timestamped captions.

*** Resynchronizing subtitles

If you're using ~subed-waveform-show-current~ or ~subed-waveform-show-all~, you can use ~M-mouse-2~ (Meta-middle-click, ~subed-waveform-shift-subtitles~) to shift the current subtitle and succeeding subtitles so that they start at the position you clicked on.

To do this with the keyboard, you can use
~subed-shift-subtitles-to-start-at-timestamp~ if you want to specify a
timestamp or ~subed-shift-subtitles~ to specify a millisecond offset.

*** Exporting text for review

You can use ~subed-copy-region-text~ to copy the text of the subtitles
for pasting into another buffer. Call it with the universal prefix
~C-u~ to copy comments as well.

** Troubleshooting
*** subed-mpv: Service name too long

If =subed-mpv-client= reports =(error "Service name too long")=, this
is probably because the path to the socket used to communicate with
MPV is too long for your operating system. You can use =M-x customize=
to set =subed-mpv-socket-dir= to a shorter path.

** Important change in v1.0.0

~subed~ now uses ~subed-srt-mode~, ~subed-vtt-mode~, and
~subed-ass-mode~ instead of directly using ~subed-mode~. These modes
should be automatically associated with the ~.vtt~, ~.srt~, and ~.ass~
extensions. If the generic ~subed-mode~ is loaded instead of the format-specific mode,
you may get an error such as:

#+begin_example
Error in post-command-hook (subed--post-command-handler): (cl-no-applicable-method subed--subtitle-id)
#+end_example

If you set ~auto-mode-alist~ manually in your config, please make sure
you associate extensions the appropriate format-specific mode instead
of ~subed-mode~. The specific backend functions (ex:
~subed-srt--jump-to-subtitle-id~) are also deprecated in favor of
using generic functions such as ~subed-jump-to-subtitle-id~.

** Testing

You'll need to install the =buttercup= and =package-lint= Emacs packages. You'll also need =GNU Make= so that you can work with Makefiles. To run the tests, use the command =make test=.

* Build tips

Here's a post-commit hook that will make it easier to remember to tag releases:

#+begin_src python :eval no
#!/usr/bin/python

# place in .git/hooks/post-commit
# Based on https://gist.github.com/ajmirsky/1245103

import subprocess
import re

print("checking for version change...",)

output = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'diff', 'HEAD^', 'HEAD', '-U0']).decode("utf-8")

version_info = None
for d in output.split("\n"):
    rg = re.compile(r'\+(?:;;\s+)?Version:\s+(?P<major>[0-9]+)\.(?P<minor>[0-9]+)\.(?P<rev>[0-9]+)')
    m = rg.search(d)
    if m:
        version_info = m.groupdict()
        break

if version_info:
    tag = "v%s.%s.%s" % (version_info['major'], version_info['minor'], version_info['rev'])
    existing = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'tag']).decode("utf-8").split("\n")
