;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The functions in this file do not expect any particular subtitle format.
;; Instead, they expect certain functions to exist that provide navigation and
;; manipulation for whatever format the current buffer contains.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-macs)
(require 'subed-config)
(require 'subed-debug)
(require 'subed-mpv)
