;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains variables, options, functions and commands for
;; displaying a waveform along with the current subtitle.  Use
;; `subed-waveform-minor-mode' to turn the waveform display on or off.
;; Press `C-x C-=' and `C-x C--' to make the amplitude of the
;; displayed waveform larger and smaller.

;; To set the start time, click the waveform with `mouse-1' (left-click).
;; To set the stop time, use `mouse-3' (right-click).
;; You can also adjust start/stop times with the following
;; keybindings from `subed-mode-map':
;; M-[ - `subed-decrease-start-time'
;; M-] - `subed-increase-start-time'
;; M-{ - `subed-decrease-stop-time'
;; M-} - `subed-increase-stop-time'

;; To play a sample from the middle of a waveform, middle-click on the
;; position you would like to play.  This plays
;; `subed-waveform-sample-msecs' milliseconds and then sets the
;; playing position to that point.

;; You can shift-drag with `mouse-1' (left mouse button) to the left
;; of a subtitle's waveform in order to extend the view earlier and
;; set the start time. `Shift-drag-mouse-3' (right mouse button) to
;; extend the view later and set the stop time.

;; To split a subtitle in the middle using the text at point, use
;; S-C-mouse-2 (control-shift middle-click), which is bound to
;; `subed-waveform-split'.

;; Customization:

;; Use `M-x customize-group subed-waveform' to configure options.  To
;; change how much time you see before or after the current subtitle,
;; set `subed-waveform-preview-msecs-before' and
;; `subed-waveform-preview-msecs-after'. You may also want to adjust
;; `subed-loop-seconds-before' and `subed-loop-seconds-after' if you
;; want this to match the looping behavior toggled with
;; `subed-toggle-loop-over-current-subtitle'. (Note the switch from
;; milliseconds to seconds.)  The boundaries of the current subtitle
;; as well as the current playing position are indicated with the
;; colors set in `subed-waveform-bar-params'.
;;
;; To change how your adjustments affect previous/next subtitles,
;; customize the `subed-enforce-time-boundaries' and
;; `subed-subtitle-spacing' variables.

;; To automatically display subtitles whenever you open a subed file,
;; add the following to your configuration:
;;
;; (with-eval-after-load 'subed
;;   (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-waveform-minor-mode))
;;
;; Troubleshooting:

;; If the waveform becomes corrupted or is out of sync (this may
;; happen for example when you modify the start/stop timestamp(s)
;; using Subed mode commands but then undo your changes), press `C-c
;; |' to redisplay it.

;; If images are not displayed, you may want to make sure that
;; `max-image-size' is set to a value that allows short, wide images.
;; The following code may help:
;;
;; (with-eval-after-load 'subed
;;   (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local max-image-size nil))))
;;
;; The bar is positioned using a percentage, so it gets a little
;; tricky for subtitles with short durations.
