;;; Commentary:

;; Customization variables, hooks, keybindings, etc for subed-mode.


;;; Code:

(defvar-local subed--subtitle-format nil
  "Short form of the name of the subtitle format in the current buffer (e.g. \"srt\").")

;; This variable is set in subed.el to avoid compiler warnings because it uses
;; functions defined in subed-common.el, and (require 'subed-common) results in
;; recursive requires.
(defvar subed-mode-map nil
  "Keymap for ‘subed-mode’.")
